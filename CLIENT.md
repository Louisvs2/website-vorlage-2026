# CLIENT.md — Client Briefing Template

> **How to use this document:** Copy this file for every new client project and fill in every field. This briefing must contain **all** information required to build the complete website without asking further questions. A field left empty is a question that will interrupt production — resolve every `[...]` placeholder before development starts. Delete this note block once the briefing is complete.

| #   | Service name | Short description (1–2 sentences)                 | Detail page? | Priority    |

## 19. Social Media

- **Gallery / reference images section?** [yes/no — feeds `npm run setup` (Galerie), aktiviert auch `/projekte`-Case-Study-Seiten pro Referenzprojekt]

## 26. Sections to Avoid

- **Explicitly unwanted sections/elements:** [e.g. "no pricing on the website", "no team photos — privacy", "no blog"]
- **Topics not to mention:** [e.g. former partnerships, discontinued services]
